# DatathonAIQualRound
Dec 16, 2024 ITU Datathon


##Overview
DatathonAI Qualification Round
Welcome to the DatathonAI qualification challenge, presented by the ITU AI Club! This competition invites participants to develop AI models that can identify Turkish cities from Google Street View images.

##Challenge Overview
Participants will build machine learning models to classify street view images into three of Turkey's most prominent cities:

Istanbul: The transcontinental metropolis bridging Europe and Asia
Ankara: The modern capital city
Izmir: The pearl of the Aegean Sea
##Competition Structure
This is a qualification round where participants compete to secure their spot in the final event. The top 30 performing teams will advance to the physical finals, which will be held at the Istanbul Technical University (ITU) campus.

##Objective
Your task is to develop a model that can accurately determine which city a given street view image belongs to. This challenges participants to identify distinct architectural styles, urban planning patterns, and geographical features that make each city unique.

##Why This Matters
This challenge explores the intersection of computer vision and urban analysis, testing participants' ability to create models that can recognize subtle differences in urban landscapes. Success in this competition demonstrates expertise in image processing, deep learning, and urban feature extraction.
