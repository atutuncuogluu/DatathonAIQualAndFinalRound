# DatathonAIQualRound
Dec 16, 2024 ITU Datathon
In this competition, the OpenCLIP, CLIP, YOLO, Swin Transformer, and other ViT models were used

## Overview
DatathonAI Qualification Round
Welcome to the DatathonAI qualification challenge, presented by the ITU AI Club! This competition invites participants to develop AI models that can identify Turkish cities from Google Street View images.

## Challenge Overview
Participants will build machine learning models to classify street view images into three of Turkey's most prominent cities:

Istanbul: The transcontinental metropolis bridging Europe and Asia
Ankara: The modern capital city
Izmir: The pearl of the Aegean Sea
##Competition Structure
This is a qualification round where participants compete to secure their spot in the final event. The top 30 performing teams will advance to the physical finals, which will be held at the Istanbul Technical University (ITU) campus.

## Objective
Your task is to develop a model that can accurately determine which city a given street view image belongs to. This challenges participants to identify distinct architectural styles, urban planning patterns, and geographical features that make each city unique.

## Why This Matters
This challenge explores the intersection of computer vision and urban analysis, testing participants' ability to create models that can recognize subtle differences in urban landscapes. Success in this competition demonstrates expertise in image processing, deep learning, and urban feature extraction.

## Overview
DatathonAI Competition
Welcome to the DatathonAI competition, presented by the ITU AI Club! This competition challenges participants to develop AI models capable of predicting the geographic coordinates of images taken within the Istanbul Technical University (ITU) Ayazağa Campus.

## Challenge Overview
Participants will build machine learning models to predict the latitude and longitude coordinates of images from the ITU Ayazağa Campus using a provided training dataset and a test dataset.

## Competition Structure
The main competition round challenges participants to compete for top rankings on Kaggle. Once the competition concludes, the top 10 teams will present their work to a jury. Final scores will be calculated based on 75% of the Kaggle performance and 25% of the jury's evaluation. The top 3 teams will then be announced.

## Objective
Your task is to develop a model that can accurately predict the geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude) of given test images taken within the ITU Ayazağa Campus. The dataset will test participants' ability to utilize image features for precise geolocation.

## Get Started
Download the training dataset containing images taken within ITU Ayazağa Campus and a CSV file with corresponding latitude and longitude coordinates.
Develop and train your prediction model.
Submit your predictions for the test dataset in latitude, longitude format.
Track your position on the leaderboard.
Join us in this exciting journey of artificial intelligence and geospatial analysis! Good luck to all participants.
